# renderling.xyz

The [renderling website](https://renderling.xyz).

## what stuff

This contains a blog, live development devlogs, a manual and documentation.

### manual and docs

The manual and docs are built by hand and checked into the repo.
There's a directory that's gitignore'd for this reason - `renderling`.

`xtask` should take care of everything, but just know that the directory is there and ignored.
