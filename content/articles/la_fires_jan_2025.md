title: LA fires, Jan 2025

_My thoughts on the fires, mostly concerned with Altadena_

The fires in LA are ripping through my hometown of Pasadena, CA. Altadena has been 
hit the worst. My Mom, Grandfather, Aunty and Uncle evacuated safely. Unfortunately 
my Aunty and Uncle's house didn't survive. They live up against the mountains in 
Altadena. Their house was amazing.

Luckily everyone in my family is safe. 

But my focus is obviously not on Renderling right now (Renderling is a software 
project of mine, which is the subject of this site).

I have surprisingly mixed feelings about these fires. I went through a very similar 
scenario in the [Tubbs fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubbs_Fire) in 2017, which 
happened the night of my birthday dinner, no less.

Before immigrating to New Zealand we lived in Santa Rosa, CA. Santa Rosa was hit by the Tubbs 
fire in 2017 - 10% of housing was destroyed in that single fire event, and then we were 
evacuated 7 _more_ times over the next 4 years.

Santa Rosa locals that lived through that will all agree that strong, hot winds are 
emotionally triggering since those fires. I'm sure it's a form of PTSD.

Luckily our house was never caught on fire, but many of our friends lost their homes, 
and this prompted us to seriously start looking for a new place to live.

We considered Vermont. We're fans of Bernie Sanders and the state seems relatively 
climate proof. 

I also considered Minnesota. "Climate proof Duluth", as they say. I 
have fond memories of Fergus Falls and have family friends in Minnesota.

We considered moving back to Pasadena where I grew up, and I started looking at houses 
in Altadena and fixers in Sierra Madre, but Altadena was really the only 
realistic 'dena neighborhood we could afford. It's an absolutely gorgeous city. After 
moving _away_ from the area in 2001 to go to college at Sonoma State I realized it's 
an incredibly diverse city, Pasadena. Altadena, specifically. Living at Sonoma 
State was a bit of a culture shock for me, honestly - I didn't realize how lucky I 
was. SSU is awesome, of course, but I was used to something different.

Ultimately I got a job offer in New Zealand and we decided to take it, seeing as 
climate change will see fires penetrating deeper into urban areas, and American 
politics are absolutely frightening. Don't even get me started on the 
president-elect's response to the fires. Absolutely abhorrent.

In hindsight it was the right decision to move away, but now I feel guilty. I'm 
not there to help my friends and family. The best I can do is be their "man in a chair".
I can also donate money. But that's about it.

Anyway - Altadena attracts a lot of new families and folks looking to get out of 
the hustle and bustle of LA, while still being close enough to work there. 

The Palisades will obviously garner most of the attention on international news 
and social media, being filled to the brim with celebrities.
