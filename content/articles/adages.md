_Things said once or twice or more_

## Pareto Principal

Aka 20/80 rule, 80/20 rule, law of the vital few, principle of factor sparsity.

> Do the 20% of the work that gets you 80% of the benefit.

## Make it work, make it right, make it fast

1. First be very practical and write a scrappy solution as
  quickly as you can, just to prove a point.
  In other words, write a proof of concept.
2. If it works, spend time planning, "architecting" a "proper" solution for the
  long term.
  Don't worry too much about performance, but keep it in mind.
3. Optimize and iterate.
  Be principled. Profile. Make measurements. Use flamegraphs.
  Humans are notoriously bad at predicting machine runtime characteristics, so
  optimize based on measurements.

## Things are not always as they seem, scan lightly

I said this! It has obvious connections to rendering, but on a deeper level
it's a philosophical plea to scan lightly.
