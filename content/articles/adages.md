## Pareto Principal

Aka 20/80 rule, 80/20 rule, law of the vital few, principle of factor sparsity.

1. First be very practical and write a scrappy solution as
  quickly as you can, just to prove a point.
  In other words, write a proof of concept.
2. If it works, spend time planning, "architecting" a "proper" solution for the
  long term.
  Don't worry too much about performance, but keep it in mind.
3. Optimize and iterate.
  Be principled. Profile. Make measurements. Use flamegraphs.
  Humans are notoriously bad at predicting machine runtime characteristics, so
  optimize based on measurements.
